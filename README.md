Lab1:
Note: resource markers are displayed only in the debug build; they are removed from release build as well as other debugging information.

Lab2:
Note: rotate the camera while holding down the RIGHT mouse button (the left button is used by imgui);
camera movement is performed using WSADQE (or arrows (WSAD) and shift/ctrl (Q/E)) buttons and is performed in GLOBAL coordinates; the mouse wheel allows you to zoom in/out of the camera in the viewing direction.
